#  DESCRIPTION

GENERATIVE-TEXT-MODEL is a Flask-based web application that generates coherent and creative text based on user prompts using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-2 model. Users can enter a prompt, choose output length, and generate multiple variations with an intuitive web interface.

---

##  FEATURES

-  Generate text based on any custom prompt
-  Supports multiple output variations
-  Control output length (short, medium, long)
-  Powered by pre-trained GPT-2 (via Hugging Face Transformers)
-  Clean and responsive Flask web interface
-  Copy or export generated text

---

##  HOW IT WORKS

- The app loads the pre-trained **GPT-2 model** from Hugging Face Transformers.
- Users input a custom prompt and select generation settings.
- The model predicts and extends the prompt to generate meaningful text based on context and tone.
